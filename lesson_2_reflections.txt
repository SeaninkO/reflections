What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

The hidden directory is created. Everything in the directory is prepared for version control. Initializing repository is essential to have all structured prepared for version control. It is like preparation of notepad when git will trace all commits I make. 


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area contains files which are tracked, but not committed yet. The repository keeps track of commits. The working directory is just a place in file system, where files are stored. Some of them might be under source control while others do not.
