When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I wpuld like to use remote repository every time I need to colaborate with other peoples or use repository from different computers. It is also a way to have a backup of important files. They easily survie any local computer or hardrive disaster.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I think it is because it may be disturbing. When I work on something, it can happen that someone push changes on GitHub touching exactly the same part of code that I modify. Instead of working I would have to struggle with conficts, checking someone else modifications and so on. On the other hand - if I work alone, I exactly know what changed and where. There is no need for automatic pull. 


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork is a way to have own copy for modifications, keeping the original verion untouched. Clone works for remote and local repositories. It is for having local and remote repository. Branch is just a way to manage different flavours of code within one repository.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

First of all, it allows working without any network connection. The other thing is a group of people can develop a different parts of the software (or even the same part) independantly. The merging mechanizm allow integration of all changes into coherent code.


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

I would probably use svn. It is also quite convinient, though part of colaboration has to be done via e-maile or phones. I can expect github is more convinient, but righ now, I know it to little...


When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

The separate branch is useful whenever I introduce sth definitelly new. It changes in a way the nature of final product. There is a risk, the changes are not as cool as I expected or they conflict someone else work. On the other hand, simple bug corrections can be done on master branch.
