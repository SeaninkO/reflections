When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I wpuld like to use remote repository every time I need to colaborate with other peoples or use repository from different computers. It is also a way to have a backup of important files. They easily survie any local computer or hardrive disaster.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I think it is because it may be disturbing. When I work on something, it can happen that someone push changes on GitHub touching exactly the same part of code that I modify. Instead of working I would have to struggle with conficts, checking someone else modifications and so on. On the other hand - if I work alone, I exactly know what changed and where. There is no need for automatic pull. 


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork is a way to have own copy for modifications, keeping the original verion untouched. Clone works for remote and local repositories. It is for having local and remote repository. Branch is just a way to manage different flavours of code within one repository.


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

I would probably use svn. It is also quite convinient, though part of colaboration has to be done via e-maile or phones. I can expect github is more convinient, but righ now, I know it to little...
